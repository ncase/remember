// Finally, add your translation here so the code "knows" your page exists!
// Copy and paste the "Example Language" paragraph into a new section,
// (make sure there's two newlines between yours and the other sections)
// and translate that. Here's what the lines in each section means
//
// 1: your language 2-letter code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
// 2: your language's name, in its native language
// 3: the URL of your page. in most cases it'll be ./[2-letter code].html,
//    but if for whatever reason your translation exists on a different domain altogether,
//    (say, you need to make significant changes to the code for your translation to work)
//    you can also link to an absolute URL elsewhere
// 4: the prompt to ask to switch to your language
//    (shows if the user's browser's language is set to yours and they're not already there)
// 5: a *casual* yes
// 6: a *casual* no
// 7: where you can credit yourself!
// 8: the link to the original English version
