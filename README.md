## How To Translate:

**[IMPORTANT:
BEFORE YOU MAKE A TRANSLATION, CHECK THE "ISSUES" TAB ABOVE,
TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE IS ALREADY WORKING ON IT.
If so, maybe you can collaborate!
And if no one else is, PLEASE CREATE A NEW ISSUE in this repo
so that others know you're working on it!]**

**Translations done so far:**    
[Русский](https://ncase.me/remember/ru.html)

To translate this project, you'll need a basic familiarity with HTML and GitHub.

**Step 1)** Clone this repo!

**Step 2)** Look up the two-letter code of the language you're translating to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

**Step 3)** *COPY* `index.html`, and name the copy [your-two-letter-code].html. 
For example: `de.html`, `ar.html`, `zh.html`, etc...

**Step 4)** Translate *THAT* page (it's about 3,500 words). Do NOT modify the original `index.html`!

**Step 5)** Go to `translations.txt`, and add a new section so that the code "knows" your translation exists.
(more specific instructions will be inside that file)

**Step 6)** Send a Pull Request so I can make your translation go live!

**Step 7)** 🎉 fweeeee
